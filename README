Adding a hook
-------------

You can create new hooks (limited to 'post-receive' for now) by creating a new file
ending with "-hook", and containing at least one these 2 functions definitions:

    ## post-receive_ref function gets called for each ref pushed with these variables
    ##     oldrev, newrev, refname
    post-receive_ref() {
          ## MY code
    }

    ## post-receive_post function gets called once per push after refs.
    post-receive_post() {
          ## MY code

    }
